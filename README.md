# Chess
Player vs Player chess using pygame.

This is a chess game designed for two players, built using the pygame and tkinter modules. When a piece is selected, all its potential moves are highlighted in yellow. If a click is made outside these highlighted squares, it is not considered a move. To aid the players, the last move made is emphasized with a light red color. If the king is in check, its square turns red as a warning. When a pawn, be it black or white, reaches the 8th rank, a window pops up for pawn promotion. The Ctrl + z keys can be used to undo a move. The game also includes special moves like castling and en passant. When the game concludes, either by checkmate or stalemate, a message box appears to announce the end.
